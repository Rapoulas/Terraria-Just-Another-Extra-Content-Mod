    Just another mod that adds some stuff that i think would be cool. Also my first mod.

    Includes a handful of items, some of them dont have a way to be obtained yet, so maybe just activate some Cheat mod and try them out.
    
    Currently also adds some hybrid set bonuses:
    (Ranged)
        Necro + Fossil
        Cobalt/Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum/Mythril + Frost
        Titanium/Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte
        Chlorophyte + Shroomite
        Shroomite + Vortex
        
    (Melee)
        Molten + Shadow
        Molten + Crimson
        Cobalt/Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum/Mythril + Frost
        Titanium/Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte

    For the frost armor sets combinations, you require atleast 1 non-frost helmet to define what class it is.
